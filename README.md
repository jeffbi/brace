# The *brace* C++ library

*brace* is a general-purpose C++ library, made up of classes and functions that I have found useful. It is very much a work in progress and I will be adding to the library from time to time. My hope is that you will find it useful too.

The core library is header-only and I expect the core to remain header-only.

## Modern C++
*brace* is written using *Modern C++*, which is to say C++17. It's 2023 and most compiler vendors by now have excellent support for C++17. *brace* is a new library and I have no intention of modifying *brace* to support older versions of the language.

## Building and Installing *brace*
Currently there is nothing to build, as *brace* is header-only. You just need to copy the `include/brace` directory to somewhere your compiler can find it and `#include` the appropriate header files in your project's source files.
